Here are Quick Steps for Running HireMe on your Machine....

For Running our Project First u need to install some Dependencies  i.e

- Python3

- MySQL 8
and small components dependencies like yaml, ttk ... which program prompts you as error while running !

Setup Database and initialise schema named `mydb`

- After your MySQL is properly setuped open "cv_schema" file under database directory and run those sql queries manually via sql terminal or workbench 4
- It will setup all require tables for running this project on local database.

The Entire Project is now setup and will run smoothly.
